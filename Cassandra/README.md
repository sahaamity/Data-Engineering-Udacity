# Project: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra
This project models user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify to optimize queries for understanding what songs users are listening to by using Apache Cassandra.
It mainly has four areas : 


1.Build up ETL to iterate/process events raw dataset and generate new dataset

2.Creating appropriate Apache Cassandra tables to answer 3 specific questions

3.Inserting data from new dataset to Apache Cassandra tables

4.Testing the results by select statements
